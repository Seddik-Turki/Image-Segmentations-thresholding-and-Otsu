# Image Segmentations: threshold, Otsu, K-means & Region-Growing
This repository demonstrates various techniques for image segmentation, including thresholding, Otsu's method, K-means clustering, and Region Growing. Each technique is implemented in a separate Jupyter notebook for clarity and ease of use.

## Project Description

Image segmentation is a crucial step in many computer vision tasks. This project explores different segmentation techniques. The methods covered include:

- **Thresholding:** Basic segmentation technique using threshold based on the histogram of the image
- **Otsu's Method:** An automatic thresholding technique that determines the optimal threshold value by minimizing intra-class variance.
- **K-means Clustering:** A clustering-based approach that partitions the image into segments based on color similarity.
- **Region Growing:** A technique that grows regions from seed points based on similarity criteria.


## Otsu's & Thresholding Method
The implementation of Otsu's and Thresholding method are  detailed in the Jupyter notebook `Threshold_Otsu.ipynb`
