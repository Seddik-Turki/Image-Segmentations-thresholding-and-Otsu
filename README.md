# Image Segmentations: thresholding & Otsu
This repository demonstrates 2 techniques for image segmentation: thresholding & Otsu's method.

## Project Description

Image segmentation is a crucial step in many computer vision tasks. This project explores 2 segmentation techniques.

- **Thresholding:** Basic segmentation technique using threshold based on the histogram of the image
- **Otsu's Method:** An automatic thresholding technique that determines the optimal threshold value by minimizing intra-class variance.
- 
## Otsu's & Thresholding Method
The implementation of Otsu's and Thresholding method are  detailed in the Jupyter notebook `Threshold_Otsu.ipynb`
